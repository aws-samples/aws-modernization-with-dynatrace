Cloud is essential to your business strategy and a smooth transition is key. Join Dynatrace and AWS for a hands-on workshop to learn how to gain advanced observability automatically at scale as you prepare to move to the cloud, iterate and migrate more applications, and gain the benefits of modern cloud native architectures and operating models.

This workshop puts you in the shoes of an engineer at the easyTravel corporation, presenting you with various problems the company is facing as they migrate to AWS and modernize their applications. It will be your task to solve them.
