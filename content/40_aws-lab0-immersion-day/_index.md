## AWS Immersion Day Objectives

This virtual hands-on workshop will start with a review of common challenges associated with modernization followed by a review of how Dynatraceâ€™s AI-engine, Davis, performs automatic and intelligent root-cause analysis in hybrid cloud AWS environments. This will be followed by series of hands-on labs where you will:

1. Setup a Dynatrace environment and sample applications within AWS
1. Jump in and fully analyze an application within Dynatrace
1. Start to see and understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and how service levels can be tightly ensured.

You are now in the drivers seat for enabling modern operations for cloud native architectures!

### Workshop structure

The workshop breaks down into three sections.  Plan on 2-4 hours for completion of the lab section.
