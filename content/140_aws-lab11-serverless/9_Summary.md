## Summary

While modernizing to or in the cloud, you want to evaluate if your modernization goes according to the plan, whether the services are still performing well or even better than before, and whether your new architecture is as efficient as the blueprint suggested. Dynatrace helps you validate all these steps automatically, which helps speed up the modernization and validation process.

Having the ability to understand service flows enables us to make smarter re-architecture and re-platforming decisions.  With support for new technologies like Kubernetes, Lambda and many other AWS technologies you have confidence to modernize with a platform that can cover the old and the new. 

### ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE**

<i>Dynatrace sees a lot of demand for Lambda serverless compute service and a slew of new capabilities and here is where to look for step by step reference [Dynatrace documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/amazon-web-services/amazon-web-services-integrations/aws-lambda-integration)</i>

### What we did

In this section, you should have completed the following:

âœ… Createded 2 Lambda functions and an RDS database

âœ… Deployeded a change to the catalog service in the staging namespace with in K8 cluster

âœ… Now we are ready to examine the modernized application using service flows through Lambda and backtraces
