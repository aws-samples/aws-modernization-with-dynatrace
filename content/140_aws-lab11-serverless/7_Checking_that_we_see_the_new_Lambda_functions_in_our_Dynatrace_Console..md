## Checking that we see the new Lambda functions in our Dynatrace Console.
In your Dynatrace tenant fron the right side menu as we did before select `AWS` and open the `CloudWatch dashboard`

Click on the `Lambda functions` box and you will notice that Dynatrace already knows about your recent deployment and is collecting on CloudWatch available metrics.  At this point the Lambdas have not yet been deployed to the catalog service so not much going on.
