## AWS Modernization with Serverless Lambda Objectives

This virtual hands-on workshop will start with a review of what is Serverless and Serverless Lambda.  We will address the benefits of serverless and lambda and also some challenges associated with the technology.  We will modernize the DT Orders application and deploy a new version of the catalog service.  This will be followed by series of hands-on labs where you will:

1. Continue to modernize the DT Orders applicaiton and deploy a serverless version of the Catalog applicaiton
1. Jump in and fully analyze the new serverless application within Dynatrace
1. Start to see and understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and how service levels can be tightly ensured.
