## More about the Dynatrace Layer
Here's how the Dynatrace Lambda Layer works and its benefits:

Easy Integration: By adding the Dynatrace Lambda Layer to your AWS Lambda functions, you can automatically monitor their performance without modifying the function's code. This layer includes the Dynatrace OneAgent, which is responsible for collecting metrics, traces, and logs.

Real-Time Visibility: Dynatrace provides real-time insights into the performance of your Lambda functions, including execution times, memory usage, and invocation counts. It helps identify performance bottlenecks, errors, and anomalies within your serverless applications.

Distributed Tracing: The Dynatrace Lambda Layer supports distributed tracing, allowing you to trace requests as they move through your serverless components and other parts of your architecture. This is crucial for understanding dependencies and interactions in microservices and serverless architectures.

Automated Anomaly Detection: Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, Dynatrace can automatically detect anomalies and potential issues in your serverless applications. This proactive monitoring can help you address problems before they impact your users.

Optimization Opportunities: By analyzing the detailed performance data collected, Dynatrace can offer insights into optimization opportunities, helping you improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with running Lambda functions.

Seamless Integration with AWS Services: The Dynatrace Lambda Layer integrates well with various AWS services and resources involved in your serverless applications, providing a comprehensive monitoring solution.
