## Introduction Serverless Lambda

We have come a long way through this migration and modernization journey we started back in Lab-0.  We simulated a migration from on prem to EC2 Compute, we then modernized our application from monolith to a microservices architecture while shifting to a containerized approach and rehosting the application on an EKS cluster.  However the journey is not yet complete,  AWS continues to deliver technology that gives us addtional solutions for our digital products.  That said, there is more we can do to improve our code base as well as our infrastructure.  In the follwing lab we will be diving into the world of AWS Serverless specifically Lambda and what makes it a technology growing in popularity.  

### What is Serverless, is it really no servers

AWS Serverless is a cloud computing model provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) where AWS manages the infrastructure, allowing adopters of the technology to build and run applications `withoutn having to manage servers`. 

Here are some key features and components of AWS Serverless:
1.  No server management is necessary
2.  Adopters are only charged for the server space they use, reducing cost
3.  Serverless architectures are inherently scalable
4.  Increased Agility
5.  Faster time to market
6.  Increased performance
7.  Optimizaes resources

Some disadvantages that must be mentioend
1. Lack of skills and resources
2. Security concerns
3. 3rd party dependancy
4. Difficult to test
5. Difficult to monitor -- `Not the case for Dynatrace`
