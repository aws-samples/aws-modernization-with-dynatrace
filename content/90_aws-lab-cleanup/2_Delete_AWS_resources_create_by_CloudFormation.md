## Delete AWS resources create by CloudFormation

To remove the resources created earlier with CloudFormation, just navigate to the CloudFormation page in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home" target="_blank">AWS console</a>, highlight a stack, and click the `Delete` button.

Plan for a few minutes for the EC2 instances, and 20-30 minutes for the EKS Cluster to be completely removed.
