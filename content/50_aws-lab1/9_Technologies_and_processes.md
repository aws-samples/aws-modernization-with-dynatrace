## Technologies and processes

By default, Dynatrace gives you FullStack horizontal (who talks to whom) and vertical (what runs on what) dependency visibility as part of Dynatrace Smartscape! All without a single line of code or configuration change ‚Äì just by installing the OneAgent.

Seeing which processes make up the monolith has been an eye-opener for many teams that have done this exercise. ‚ÄúOh ‚Äì we completely forgot about the dependency to this legacy process we introduced 5 years ago!‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs a common thing you hear!

As you plan your migration, knowing what technologies make up your eco-system is key so what you can decide whether to migrate, refactor or replace certain services.

The workshop is somewhat limited, so here is an example from another environment.

### üëç How this helps

This is another out-of-the-box feature that helps you understand what technologies are in your environment with a heat map presentation to what degree they exist.

### Review Technologies and processes View

1. Click on the **Technologies and processes** link on the left side menu within Dynatrace to view the technologies that OneAgent was able to automatically discover and instrument.

2 . Explore all the integration options of Dynatrace while you are in the Hub

You can always click into the `Hub` menu within Dynatrace to learn about the many technologies that Dynatrace supports.
