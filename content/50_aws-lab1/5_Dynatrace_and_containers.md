## Dynatrace and containers

In the picture above, the arrow shows the properties for Docker.

Our sample app was built as a Docker container and Dynatrace hooks into containers and provides code for injecting OneAgent into containerized process.  

### How Dynatrace monitors containers

Dynatrace hooks into containers and provides code for injecting OneAgent into containerized processes.

Thereâ€™s no need to modify your Docker images, modify run commands, or create additional containers to enable Docker monitoring. Simply install OneAgent on your hosts that serve containerized applications and services. Dynatrace automatically detects the creation and termination of containers and monitors the applications and services contained within those containers.
