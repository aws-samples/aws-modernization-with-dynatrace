## Trigger Custom Problem Alerts

### 1. SSH to monolith host 

To connect to the host, simply use `EC2 Instance Connect`.  To this, navigate to the `EC2 instances` page in the AWS console.

From the list, pick the `dt-orders-monolith` and then the `connect` button.

Then on the next page, choose the `EC2 Instance Connect` option and then the `connect` button.

Once you connected, you will see the terminal prompt like the below.

```
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1045-aws x86_64)
...
...
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-118:~$ 
```

### 2. Trigger a CPU problem

Using a unix utility <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-stress-test-your-cpu-on-linux" target="_blank">yes</a>, we can generate CPU stress just by running the `yes` command a few times.

In the terminal, copy all these lines and run them:

```
yes > /dev/null &
yes > /dev/null &
yes > /dev/null &
```

To verify, run this command:

```
ps -ef | grep yes
```

The output should look like this:

```
ubuntu    5802  5438 99 20:48 pts/0    00:00:05 yes
ubuntu    5805  5438 89 20:48 pts/0    00:00:04 yes
ubuntu    5806  5438 97 20:48 pts/0    00:00:03 yes
ubuntu    5818  5438  0 20:48 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto yes
```
3 . Back in Dynatrace within the `host` view, the CPU should now be high as shown below

4 . It may take a minute or so, but you will get two problem cards as shown below.  #1 is the alert from the `severity = RESOURCE` where Davis was invoked, and #2 is the alert from `severity = CUSTOM ALERT`.

### 3. Review Problem Notifications

1 . Navigate to `Settings --> Integrations --> Problem Notifications` 

2 . Read the overview and then click the `Add Notification` button

3 . Click various `Notification types` from the drop down to review the configurations inputs.

4 . For the `Custom integration` type, review the option to customize the payload.

5 . Notice how you can choose the `Alert profile`, but you only have default

### 4. Review Alerting Profiles

1 . Navigate to `Settings --> Alerting --> Alerting profiles`

2 . Read the overview and then expand the `default` rule.

3 . Now add one, by clicking on the `Add alerting profile` button

4 . Review the options to choose severity rules and filters

### 5. Stop the CPU problem

To stop the problem, you need to `kill` the processes.  To do this:

1 . Back in the CloudShell, run this command to get the process IDs `ps -ef | grep yes`

2 . For each process, copy the process ID and run `kill <PID>`

For example:

```
#### If output is this...

ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-118:~$ ps -ef | grep yes
ubuntu    5802  5438 99 20:48 pts/0    00:00:05 yes
ubuntu    5805  5438 89 20:48 pts/0    00:00:04 yes
ubuntu    5806  5438 97 20:48 pts/0    00:00:03 yes

#### Then run...

kill 5802
kill 5805
kill 5806
```
Or better to use the below command to kill all the PID's at once
```
kill $(ps -ef | grep yes | awk '{print $2}' | sed '$d')
```
Or even more effective is:
```
pkill yes
```
**Always more than 1 way to skin a cat**

3 . Verify they are gone by running this again `ps -ef | grep yes`

4 . Verify that CPU in Dynatrace goes to normal and the problems will eventually automatically close

### 6. Exit the SSH

Simply type `exit` to exit the VM and return the CloudShell.

### ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE** 

* Alert configuration is available through the <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/anomaly-detection-api/anomaly-detection-api-metric-events/" target="_blank">Anomaly detectionâ€”metric events API</a>. Using the API, you can list, update, create, and delete configurations.
