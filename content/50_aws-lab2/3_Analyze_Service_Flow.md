## Analyze Service Flow

Now that we are back on the frontend service, lets look at the service flow to see whats different now.  Just click on the `View service flow` button to open this.

### Response time perspective

You should now be on the `Service flow` page.

Right away, we can see how this application is structured:  

* Frontend calls order, customer, and catalog service
* Order service calls order and customer service

Something you would never know from the application web UI !

Refer to the picture above:

1. We are viewing the data from a `Response time perspective`. Shortly, we will review the `Throughput perspective`.
1. Click on the boxes to expand the response time metrics. We can see that most of the response time, most of the time is spent in the `order` service and the least in the `customer` services.  And as in the monolith version of the application, a very small amount of the response time is spent in the databases. 

### Throughput perspective

Refer to the picture above:

1. Change to the `Throughput perspective` by clicking on the box
1. Click on the boxes to expand the metrics to see the number of requests and average response times going to each service
