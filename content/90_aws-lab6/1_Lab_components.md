**#1 . Sample Application**
Sample app representing a "services" architecture of a frontend and multiple backend services implemented as Docker containers that we will review in this lab.

**#2 . Kubernetes**
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is hosting the application. The Kubernetes cluster had the Dynatrace OneAgent Operator installed. (see below for more details).  Two EKS nodes make up the Kubernetes cluster. The Dynatrace OneAgent was preinstalled by the OneAgent operator and is sending data to your Dynatrace SaaS environment. (see below for more details)

**#3 . Dynatrace Operator**
Dynatrace OneAgent is container-aware and comes with built-in support for out-of-the-box monitoring of Kubernetes. Dynatrace supports full-stack monitoring for Kubernetes, from the application down to the infrastructure layer.

**#4 . Dynatrace**
Dynatrace tenant where monitoring data is collected and analyzed.

**#5 . Full-Stack Dashboard**
Made possible by the Dynatrace OneAgent that will automatically instrument each running node & pod in EKS.

**#6 . Kubernetes Dashboard**
The Kubernetes page provides an overview of all Kubernetes clusters showing monitoring data like the clustersâ€™ sizing and utilization.
