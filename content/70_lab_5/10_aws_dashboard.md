In addition to monitoring your AWS workloads using OneAgent, Dynatrace provides integration with AWS CloudWatch which adds infrastructure monitoring to gain insight even into serverless application scenarios.

## üëç How this helps

Dynatrace brings value by enriching the data from AWS CloudWatch extending observability into the platform with additional metrics for cloud infrastructure, load balancers, API Management Services, and more.

These metrics are managed by Dynatrace's AI engine automatically and this extended observability improves operations, reduces MTTR and increases innovation. 

Here is an example from another environment.
