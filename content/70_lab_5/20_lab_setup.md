There are several ways one can configure the Dynatrace AWS monitor, but for this workshop we will use a quick solution using AWS Role based access following these basic steps:

1. Create AWS IAM policy for monitoring
1. Start the creation of a new AWS role for monitoring
1. Start the creation of a Dynatrace AWS connection and generate connection token
1. Complete AWS policy role setup by adding the Dynatrace token and attaching AWS policy
1. Complete the Dynatrace Connection setup by adding the AWS account

## Step 1 of 5: Create AWS IAM policy for monitoring

The AWS monitoring policy defines the minimum scope of permissions you need to give to Dynatrace to monitor the services running in your AWS account. Create it once and use anytime when enabling Dynatrace access to your AWS account.

1 . Go to `Identity and Access Management (IAM)` in your Amazon Console.

2 . Go to `Policies` and click the `Create policy` button.

3 . Select the JSON tab, and paste this predefined policy from the box below.

4 . You can skip over the `Add tags` page

5 . One the `Review policy` page, use the policy name of `dynatrace_monitoring_policy`

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-policy-name.png)

6 . Click `Create policy` button.

## Step 2 of 5: Start the creation of a new AWS role for monitoring

To give Dynatrace SaaS the role-based monitoring access to your AWS account, you need to create a dedicated monitoring role for Dynatrace in your AWS account. Dynatrace will use this role to authenticate in your AWS environment with the scope of permissions as defined by the monitoring policy.

1 . Go to `Identity and Access Management (IAM)` in your Amazon Console.

2 . Go to `Roles` and click the `create role` button.

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-role.png)

3 . Paste `509560245411` into the `Account ID` field

4 . Select the `Another AWS account` tile as to establish trust with the Dynatrace account.

5 . Select the `Require external ID` checkbox

6 . Keep this page open and move to next section

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-role-trust-account.png)

### ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE** 

*The AWS Account ID for Dynatrace SaaS (e.g. https://YOUR_TENANT.live.dynatrace.com/) is `509560245411`. This AWS Account ID is the account that the role within the AWS account you are using for the workshop will use. If you were using your own Dynatrace managed cluster, this AWS Account ID value would be different.*

## Step 3 of 5: Start the creation of a Dynatrace AWS connection and generate connection token

In you don't have it already, open another browser tab and sign in to Dynatrace

1 . Once logged in, go to `Settings -> Cloud and virtualization -> AWS`

2 . Click `Connect new instance` button

3 . Enter the name for this connection as `dynatrace-modernize-workshop`

4 . Select Role based authentication method.

5 . click the `Generate token` button

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-dt.png)

6 . Leave IAM role and AWS Account blank for now and click the `Copy` button next to the generated token.

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-dt-copy.png)

Keep this browser window open. We will come back to it shortly to copy the Token and test the connection.

### ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE** 

The Token generated on the Dynatrace AWS connection page is used in the `external ID` field for the AWS role to add another level of security so that the AWS role can only access the data for your specific Dynatrace tenant and Dynatrace connection. 

## Step 4 of 5: Complete AWS policy role setup by adding the Dynatrace token and attaching AWS policy

Now back in the AWS console tab `Create Role` page you already have open, enter these values:

Paste the `Token` value that you just copied from your Dynatrace AWS connection page to the `External ID` field

Your page should look like this:

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-role-account.png)

7 . Now click the `Next: Permissions` button on the bottom

8 . On the `Attach permissions` policies page, choose the monitoring policy you created earlier. Search for: `dynatrace_monitoring_policy`. Choose then checkbox next to it and then click the Next: Review button.

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-role-policy.png)

9 . Now click the `Next: Tags` button on the bottom

10 . On the `Add Tags` page, leave the defaults and click the `Next: Review` button on the bottom

11 . On the `Review page`, provide the role name of: `dynatrace_monitoring_role`.

The role name, trusted entities and policy should have values as shown here.

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-role-policy-name.png)

9 . Click the `Create Role` button.

## Step 5 of 5: Complete the Dynatrace Connection setup by adding the AWS account

Now that we have the AWS role, itâ€™s time to connect Dynatrace to your Amazon AWS account using that role.

1 . Go back on the Dynatrace connection page you still have open

2 . In the Role field, use the name of the role you created easier: `dynatrace_monitoring_role`

4 . The `Account ID` is the AWS account you want us to pull metrics from. To get your Account ID, go to your AWS Cloudshell and type in this command and copy the `Account` value from the JSON output as shown here.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

The output will look like and the `Account = 999111222333`

```
{
    "UserId": "AKDA4GOORJDPOW3CNKDSKD7:tom.jones@mycompany.com",
    "Account": "999111222333",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::838488672964:assumed-role/dtRoleAccountAdmin/tom.jones@mycompany.com"
}
```

4 . Your `Connection page` should now look like this:

![image](/images/dt-aws-dashboard-final.png)

5 . Click the `Connect` button to verify and once verified, click the `Save` button.

If successful, your should see the configuration now on the AWS connections page:
