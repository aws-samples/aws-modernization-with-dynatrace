The Dynatrace Orders sample application has pre-built problems with different versions.  

These problems can be enabled with a `setversion` URL that can be used to change the version and thus the behavior of the application. Version 1 is the **"normal"** behavior and problems are enabled by setting the version to a value such as 2 or 3.

In the next section, you will run a unix script that sets these problems.
