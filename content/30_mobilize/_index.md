# Migration Assessment, Readiness and planning

![image](/images/florian.png)

Meet Florian, one the architects assigned to choose the right strategies, such as rehosting or rearchitect, for migrating the easyTravel customer application to AWS. Florian knows there are different risks, costs, and benefits of these [common adoption strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance).

But one big challenge Florian faces is that the previous architect is no longer with the company so all the details of what is where and what is dependent on what within the technical stack is missing or poorly documented. All that exists is a diagram and notes on a wiki page he found that was last updated in 2013.

**Not having enough details about the current environment is hindering easyTravels ability to make the right decisions when planning what to migrate and when.**

To address this problem, you and Florian are going to install Dynatrace’s OneAgent to automatically discover the easyTravel application, services, processes, and build a complete dependency mapping for the entire application environment. So, let’s begin!
