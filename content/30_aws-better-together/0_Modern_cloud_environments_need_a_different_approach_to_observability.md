## Modern cloud environments need a different approach to observability

Conventional application performance monitoring (APM) emerged when software was mostly monolithic and update cycles were measured in years, not days. Manual instrumentation and performance base lining, though cumbersome, were once adequate—particularly since fault patterns were generally known and well understood.

As monoliths get replaced by cloud-native applications, that are rapidly growing in size, traditional monitoring approaches are no longer enough. Rather than instrumenting for a predefined set of problems, enterprises need complete visibility into every single component of these dynamically scaling micro service environments. This includes multi-cloud infrastructures, container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, service meshes, functions-as-a-service and polyglot container payloads.

Such applications are more complex and unpredictable than ever. System health problems are rarely well understood from the outset and IT teams spend a significant amount of time manually solving problems and putting out fires after the fact. The challenge with modern cloud environments is to address the unknown unknowns—the kind of unique glitches that have never occurred in the past. 

Lets next review a few common challenges the are driving the need for better observability and automation as applications are modernizing.
