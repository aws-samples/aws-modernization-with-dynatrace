## Why Dynatrace

Cloud modernization is a challenging problem and it can be extremely costly for your business if you donâ€™t prepare properly for it. As you modernize and move apps to the AWS cloud, there are three generally acknowledged areas to focus on around the decision and execution process:

**Plan better**

* Evaluate that the app is well suited for cloud with essential early insights
* Assess that the new design and cloud architecture will work well and be effective

**Execute faster**

* Avoid problems that impact service delivery and cause delays by identifying issues quickly, in full context
* Resolve problems faster, reducing overall project risk

**Optimize operations**

* Feel confident that expectation is met for service delivery through clarity on performance before and after migration to the cloud
* Identify areas for automation
