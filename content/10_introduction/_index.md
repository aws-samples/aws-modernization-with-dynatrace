[Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/technologies/aws-monitoring/s) is an [AWS Advanced Technology Partner](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Dynatrace&id=001E000000texmiIAA) and AWS DevOps, Migration, and Containers Competency Partner. Dynatrace provides software intelligence to simplify enterprise cloud complexity and accelerate digital transformation. With AI and complete automation, the company’s all-in-one platform provides answers, not just data, about the performance of applications, the underlying infrastructure and the experience of all users. 

Dynatrace has pioneered and expanded the collection of observability data in highly dynamic cloud environments with the Dynatrace OneAgent.  When an organization installs the OneAgent, it automatically detects all applications, containers, services, processes, and infrastructure in real-time with zero manual configuration or code changes. System components are automatically instrumented collect not only metrics, logs and traces, but a broader view of your environment including full topological model with entity relationships, code-level detail, and user experience – all in context.

## Workshop Learning Objectives

This virtual hands-on workshop will start with a review of common challenges associated with modernization followed by a review of how Dynatrace’s AI-engine, Davis, performs automatic and intelligent root-cause analysis in hybrid cloud AWS environments. This will be followed by series of hands-on labs where you will:

1. Setup a Dynatrace environment and sample applications within AWS
1. Jump in and fully analyze an application within Dynatrace
1. Start to see and understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and how service levels can be tightly ensured.

You are now in the drivers seat for enabling modern operations for cloud native architectures!

## Workshop structure

The workshop breaks down into three sections.  Plan on 2-4 hours for completion of the lab section.

* **Prerequisites** - Ensure your Dynatrace and AWS accounts are set-up
* **Workshop Labs** - Divided into modules, some labs include a step to run scripts that will provision AWS resources, deploy sample application, and configure Dynatrace.
* **Cleanup Resources**  - Tear down workshop resources and keep on using the Free Trial!
