## Objectives

We now have a moden microservices application hosted on AWS, but is it secure? The number of reported vulnerabilities is growing every year and examples like log4shell have shown us how severe they can be and how hard it is to quickly identify and resolve them.

As we have seen in the previous labs, Dynatrace helps you detect problems proactively and this also applies to security. Dynatrace Application Security detects third-party vulnerabilities at runtime, providing you with a continuous assessment of your deployed applications.

### Objectives of this Lab

ðŸ”· Enable Dynatrace Application Security to find potential vulnerabilities our application

ðŸ”· Become familiar with the user interface by reviewing some of the identified vulnerabilities

ðŸ”· See how Davis Security Score helps us prioritize vulnerabilities
