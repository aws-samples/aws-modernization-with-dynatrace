Enterprises have many hosts, services, and application that are ever changing. The ability to automatically discover and change as the environment changes is a key feature that Smartscape delivers.  

Dynatrace's near real-time environment-topology visualization tool, Smartscape, is where Dynatrace's auto-discovery is delivered into a quick and efficient visualization of all the topological dependencies in your infrastructure, processes, and services.

## üëç How this helps

Smartscape shows all the dependencies of a given service. Those include connections to queues, web servers, app servers, and a native process. The host view shows historical and live time-series data for usage as well as the consuming processes. This information allows us to better plan the migration, as all depending services must be considered during the migration.
