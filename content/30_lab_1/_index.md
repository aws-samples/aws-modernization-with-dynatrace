While choosing the right migration strategies, such as re-hosting or re-architecting, one must access the different risks, costs, and benefits. However, often the details of what is where and what is dependent on what within the technical stack is missing or poorly documented.  All that may exist is out of date diagrams and a mix of monitoring tool metrics that must be "stiched" together.

Not having enough details about the current environment is hindering organization's ability to make the right decisions when planning what to migrate and when.

To address this problem, Dynatraceâ€™s OneAgent can automatically discover the application, services, processes and to build a complete dependency mapping for the entire application environment. So, letâ€™s begin!
