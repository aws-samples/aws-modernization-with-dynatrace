## Process

In the Smartscape view, we saw the visualizations of the relationships in vertical stack and as well as the relationships spatially. Now let‚Äôs view the processes and services running on the host.

As you plan your migration, you need more than just host level metrics.  Knowing the details for each service, **BEFORE** you change it, will lower the risk of impacting the business.

### üëç How this helps

Very quickly we have seen what processes and services are running on a host AND more importantly, what processes and services call (outbound) and are being called (inbound).  Having a real-time picture is certainly more accurate that out of date documentation.

### Lets Review!

Return back to the host view for the host with the prefix of `dt-orders-monolith` and locate the `Processes and Containers` section.

Click on the `monolith-frontend` process to open the process detail view.
