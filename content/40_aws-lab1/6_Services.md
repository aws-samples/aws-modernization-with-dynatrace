## Services

Web applications consist of web pages that are served by web servers and web application processes, for example Tomcat. Web and mobile applications are built upon services that process requests like web requests, web service calls, and messaging. 

Such "server-side services" can take the form of web services, web containers, database requests, custom services, and more. Services may in turn call other services such as web services, remote services, and databases services.

### üëç How this helps

As you plan your migration, it is important to gain a complete picture of interdependency to the rest of the environment architecture at host, processes, services, application perspectives. Since time is always scarce, being able to do this in a single place can shorten assessment timelines.

### Services

Let‚Äôs now take a look at all the services being monitored by clicking on the `Services` left side Dynatrace menu.

The filtered list should now look like this:

Choose the `frontend` service.

On the `frontend` service page, find the `Dynamic Web Requests` section on the right and click the `view Dynamic Requests` button to see what it calls.

On this page you can view the transactions as time-series charts.

On this page you can view the "top requests" and their response time consumption.  You should recognize the URLs from the sample app!

By clicking on one of the requests, the time-series charts are filtered to just that one request.

### Analysis View

On the top if the page on the right is a button labeled `Create Analysis view`, click that.

Tryout the options available to view, filter and analyze data.

### Analyze Service Flow

We just saw one way to review process and service communication, but let‚Äôs look at how Dynatrace understands and visualizes your applications‚Äô transactions from end-to-end using S`Service Backtraces` and `Service flows`

* With `Service flow`, you see the flow of service calls **FROM** a service, request, or their filtered subset. Along with the specific services that are triggered, you can also see how each component of a request contributes to the overall response time.

* With `Service backtrace`, you see the calls **TO** a service.

Knowing the type of access, executed statements, and amount of data transferred during regular hours of operation allows for better planning and prioritization of the move groups. In some cases, you may decide to not migrate this database in favor of other services or databases that are less complex to migrate due to fewer dependencies.
