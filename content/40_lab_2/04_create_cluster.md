Once you run the command to create the cluster, it will take 20-30 minutes to fully provision.

1 . Copy the `eksctl create cluster ...` command below and run it.

```
eksctl create cluster --region us-west-2 --with-oidc --ssh-access --version=1.21 --managed --name dynatrace-workshop --tags "Purpose=dynatrace-modernization-workshop" --ssh-public-key <YOUR-Key Pair-NAME>
```

It is OK when you get an error like this...

```
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
```

...because you **MUST** replace the argument value for `--ssh-public-key` with your Key Pair name that was automatically created in Lab 1 for the EC2 instance


2 . To get you Key Pair name that was automatically created in Lab 1 for the EC2 instance, navigate to the `Key Pairs` page in the AWS console:
* [https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#KeyPairs](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#KeyPairs). The Key Pair name will be something like `jones-dynatrace-modernize-workshop` as shown below.

3 . Copy the Key Pair name and then back in the CLoudShell, click the `up arrow keyboard button` to get the previous command.

4 . Adjust the `--ssh-public-key <YOUR-Key Pair-NAME>` argument and then run the command again.

If you still get an error, first check that you have the correct `--ssh-public-key` argument value.

### ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE**

*Optionally, you can adjust the argument value for `--name dynatrace-workshop` if you are sharing an AWS account with others as to make it a unique name.*

5 . Review the output will start to look like this and may take 20-30 minutes to fully provision..

```

6 . Also verify the CloudFormation script is also complete within the AWS console.

You can navigate to the CloudFormation page as shown below.

Or use this link as shortcut to the CloudFormation page
* [https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)

On the CloudFormation page, click on the stack shown.

Then click on `Events` to see the provisioning steps. As it processes, the statuses will start to show `CREATE_COMPLETE`

You can monitor this as it runs for about 30 minutes. When it's complete, all statuses will show `CREATE_COMPLETE`
