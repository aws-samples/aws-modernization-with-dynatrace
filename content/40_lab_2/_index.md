Re-hosting (also referred to as lift and shift) is a common migration use case. Re-architecture and Re-platform are steps that break the traditional architectures and replace individual components with cloud services and microservices.

We just learned how we can get great information on services, processes and user requests using Dynatrace and OneAgent. This helps us now decide what individual features or complete applications based on business benefits we need to migrate and modernize. The idea here is to focus on feature-based business benefit with functional migration. 

## Objectives of this Lab 

ðŸ”· Install the Dynatrace Operator and sample application

ðŸ”· Review how the sample application went from a simple architecture to multiple services 

ðŸ”· Examine the transformed application using service flows and backtraces
