From the Cloudshell window, run these commands to start the provisioning process:

```
cd ~/aws-modernization-dt-orders-setup/provision-scripts
./provision-workshop.sh k8
```

The script output will look like this:

```
===================================================================
About to Provision Workshop - k8
===================================================================
Proceed? (y/n)

```

Select `Y` and when it completes, it will look like this:

```
...
...
=============================================
Provisioning AWS workshop resources COMPLETE
End: Tue Jun 16 14:42:22 EDT 2020
=============================================
```

The script will run fast, but it will take about 1-2 minutes for the CloudFormation script to complete.
